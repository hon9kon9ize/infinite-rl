[PROMPT]

What is the integral of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 4x + 1 with respect to x?

[ANSWER]

(1/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + x + C

[RESPONSE]

The integral of the function f(x) = 2x^3 - 4x + 1 can be found by integrating each term separately:

∫(2x^3 - 4x + 1)dx = ∫2x^3dx - ∫4xdx + ∫1dx

Using the power rule (∫x^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C):

= 2x^4/4 - 4x^2/2 + x + C
= (1/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + x + C

<answer>(1/2)x^4 - 2x^2 + x + C</answer>
